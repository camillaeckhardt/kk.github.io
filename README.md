Happy Birthday to my sweet baby sister. I can't believe your 15. I'm not really good at writing 
sweet things so bare with me. English isn't my strong suit as were both aware. I'm sorry I can't
get you a better gift. One day I will have so much money of my own then the gifts will be better. 
I love watching you grow up. I hope we'll be bestfriends forever and you never hate me. You and izzy are my world. Anyways this is like a virtual card your own personal website that you can go back to anytime with the link. Maybe I'll start writing in this every holiday then it will become one big journal basically of all the nice things i've said to you. Anyways I won't make you read a whole bunch love you my girl.
I thought this photo was funny kinda reminds me of you hahah!
